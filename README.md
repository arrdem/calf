# Calf

> Calf: Noun.
A young cow or ox.

Calf is a scratchpad for [ox](http://ox-lang.org) in Python.
Maybe it'll grow up into a real Ox, or maybe it'll become a tasty dinner and some other calf will take its place.

## WTF?

It's a Clojure-like.
In Python.
Because fuck it, and why let Tim have all the fun and hy is nice but not my flavor.

It's not gonna be very Clojure-like tho.
In fact who the hell knows what this is gonna be.
